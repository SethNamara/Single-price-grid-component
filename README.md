## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about grid and flexbox 


### challenges
I my main section I created a div that acted as a container which conained 3 divs, but I found it had to center it well, Yes I did center the content when you look at it the code works well but when i added a box shadow to the container, Its height can be seen that it takes up a height of the view port.
